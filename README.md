# UE Handy Tools

Welcome to the **UE Handy Tools** repository! This collection of tools is designed to enhance productivity and streamline common tasks in Unreal Engine development. The tools available in this repository aim to simplify workflows, improve efficiency, and extend the capabilities of Unreal Engine.

## üöÄ Tools Overview

### 1. Logging Utility
**Description:** A robust logging tool to assist with debugging and monitoring in Unreal Engine. It provides various log levels (e.g., Debug, Warning, Error) and can be easily integrated into any project.

**Features:**
- Customizable log levels.
- Color-coded messages for better visibility.
- Easy integration into existing projects.

### 2. JSON Library
**Description:** A utility for reading, parsing, and writing JSON data within Unreal Engine. It abstracts the complexity of JSON handling, allowing for easy manipulation of JSON objects.

**Features:**
- Load and save JSON files.
- Parse JSON strings into Unreal Engine-compatible objects.
- Utility functions for retrieving and manipulating JSON data.

### 3. Localization Tool
**Description:** A flexible localization tool that allows developers to manage and switch between multiple languages in their projects. It supports JSON-based localization data and enables dynamic language switching.

**Features:**
- Load localization data from JSON files.
- Dynamically switch languages during runtime.
- Retrieve localized strings using a universal key-based system.

### 4. Interactables System
**Description:** A system to create and manage interactable objects in your Unreal Engine project. This tool provides a framework for defining interactive behaviors, triggering events, and managing interactions.

**Features:**
- Easy-to-use interface for defining interactable objects.
- Event-driven system for triggering interactions.
- Supports multiple interaction types (e.g., click, hover).

## üì¶ Future Tools

This repository is a growing collection of tools, and we plan to expand it with more utility tools for Unreal Engine. Here are some of the tools we aim to develop:

- **Asset Management Tool:** Manage, organize, and batch process assets such as textures, models, and audio files.
- **Dialogue System Tool:** Create and manage dialogues for characters, including branching conversations.
- **Level Design Helper:** Assist in level design with procedural generation and quick placement tools.
- **Performance Profiler:** Monitor and analyze game performance to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
- **AI Behavior Designer:** Visual tool for creating and managing AI behaviors using behavior trees or state machines.
- **Material Editor Extensions:** Extend the Material Editor with custom nodes and pre-built shader functions.
- **Animation Toolkit:** Tools for retargeting, blending, and managing animations.
- **Blueprint Debugging Tools:** Enhanced debugging tools for better visualization of execution flow and variable states.
- **Version Control Integration:** Integrate with version control systems to manage branching, merging, and diffing within the editor.
- **Custom Editor Widgets:** Reusable custom editor widgets and panels for various tasks.
- **Audio Management Tool:** Organize and manage audio assets, including spatial audio setup and sound cue management.
- **Procedural Content Generation Tool:** Generate procedural content like levels, foliage, or textures.
